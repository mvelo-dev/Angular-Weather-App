## Technologies

- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **API**: [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) (or any similar weather API)

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **Angular CLI** (version 12 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/angular-weather-app.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd angular-weather-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies for the Angular frontend:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

4. Install dependencies for the Node.js backend:
   ```bash
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

### Environment Variables

1. In the `server` directory, create a `.env` file to store your API key for the weather service:
   ```env
   WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
   PORT=5000
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the Node.js server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the Angular frontend:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ng serve
   ```

3. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:4200`.

## Usage

1. Open the application and enter the name of a city in the search bar.
2. View the real-time weather information for the selected location, including temperature, humidity, and weather description.

## API Endpoints

The Node.js backend is structured to provide weather data via a simple API endpoint:

- **GET `/api/weather?city={cityName}`**: Fetches weather information for a given city name.

Example response:
```json
{
  "city": "New York",
  "temperature": "15Â°C",
  "humidity": "80%",
  "description": "Clear sky"
}
```
